# MLPROJECT
Student Admission Prediction 
This is my machine learning project that predicts the chance of university admission based on academic and research profiles.
I used the Admission Prediction dataset containing features like GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, SOP, LOR, university rating, and research experience.
Techniques used include data normalization, logistic regression, cross-validation, and performance evaluation (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix).
Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand data patterns and model performance.
The project is implemented in Python using Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn libraries.
